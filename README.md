Introducing MDA Raju's CodSoft Internship Creation: To-Do List App
I proudly present an app crafted during my CodSoft Internship. Developed by MDA Raju, this app offers efficient task management,
allowing users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Notably, it includes a due date feature for timely organization. 
This innovation reflects my dedication to blending technology and practicality, showcasing the skills honed during my internship.

Best regards,
MDA Raju
